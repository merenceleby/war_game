# war_game
I developed a 3D war game with geometric shapes without using assets. 
When the player shoots and hits the cubes, the Shoot Score in the left table will start to increase. 
If the player touches the cubes or tries to drag them with the mouse, then the Cube Detect Score in the top right table will start increasing.
